Maptime Madison is a monthly meetup for anyone that wants to learn about and make maps.  It is that simple! People with all levels of mapping experience is welcomed. [Maptime](http://www.maptime.io/) is a place for collaborative learning and time to work on mapping projects.  Every month a event will be hosted with some time to learn about mapping and some hands on opportunities.

We'll be hosting our events in the Madison downtown area and will post the locations and times to this site.  If you have any suggestions about Maptime Madison or want to get involved let us know [@MaptimeMadison](https://twitter.com/MaptimeMadison)

Happy Mapping!
